<body>
    Hello! My name is Sarah Chin. I'm an Industrial and Interaction Design major interested in exploring UX design. I am a Leadership Scholar and a member of the Renée Crown Honors Society at Syracuse University. I am enthusiastic about all forms of design, including graphic communications, which has led me to become proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. As a Rhode Islander, I am proud to have interned in the creative services team of WaterFire Providence, creating various graphics and promotional material for their events. When I have free time, I enjoy acrylic painting and making art for other people. In all of my work, I believe in putting in my best effort so that I can be proud of what I was able to accomplish, no matter the outcome. Thank you for stopping by my first web page– I hope you enjoy it!
